Deeplink to open nft-plus.me in phantom browser




Edit this deeplink and href to it when you detect that the user is using mobile AND clicks on something that should direct them to an in-app browser. This is for phantom. Characters like hyphen "-" don't need url-encoding, also the domain extension.
